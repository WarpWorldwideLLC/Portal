Local  Git Repository

On your machine, first you will need to navigate to the project folder using git bash. When you get there you do:

# git init "/Users/jarp/Dropbox/Personal/WARP Worldwide/WARP Source/JWeb"

which initiates a new git repository in that directory.

When you've done that, you need to register that new repo with a remote (where you'll upload -- push -- your files to), which in this case will be github. You'll get the correct URL from your repo on GitHub.

#  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/WarpWorldwideLLC/Portal.git
You need to add you existing files to your local commit:

Get anythng already there. 
git pull https://github.com/WarpWorldwideLLC/Portal.git

git add .   # this adds all the files
Then you need to make an initial commit, so you do:

git commit -a -m "Initial commit" # this stages your files locally for commit. 
                                  # they haven't actually been pushed yet
Now you've created a commit in your local repo, but not in the remote one. To put it on the remote, you do the second line you posted:

git push -u origin --all



git pull https://github.com/WarpWorldwideLLC/Portal.git

Some text notes. 




Maven & GSON

First you need to clone the repository locally on your computer:

git clone https://github.com/google/gson
Then you go inside the project folder ./gson and you create the jar file running:

mvn package
Of course to do this you need to have maven installed, if you are under osx you can install it running

brew install maven
Otherwise you can look for the installation for your system on the maven official website

After running mvn package the jar file will be in ./gson/gson/target/gson-2.7.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
